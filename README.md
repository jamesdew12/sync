# sync-tech-test
I started off this tech test on monday with very little experience in working in nodejs.
Test Requirements

1) Using ES6 standards and using NodeJS create a project which uses frameworks including crypto2
2) Use await & async or promises.
3) Create 2 endpoints/routes, a) adds data to noSql db of your choice. b) lists data in that db in Postman response
4) Validate the input data, so that only alphanumeric is accepted on adding endpoint.
5) Encrypt the data so that itâ€™s stored using RSA with crypto2 framework.
6) Decrypt the data when listing so that its human readable.
7) Provide Readme how to run everything which includes postman export so that I can test it quickly

(Postman is program which a bit like a browser, which can trigger calls to an API)
